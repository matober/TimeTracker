//AJAX JS file for the Ajax calls
//Mainly used for the create and edit functions for the Activity Controller

//This tells the home view to replace the contents of the DOM element with an ID of "theActivities" with the render
$("#theActivities").html("<%= j (render 'display_activities') %>");

//This is to re-initialize the Jquery script that allows the user to sort the activities
//Without this, the sortable ability stops working as the newly rendered activity are no longer linked
//to the sortable script
